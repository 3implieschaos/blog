<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The IAU XXX General Assembly <a href="https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1810/">closed today</a>
and has passed <a href="https://www.iau.org/static/archives/announcements/pdf/ann18029e.pdf">Resolution B4</a>
calling for renaming Hubble's Law to the Hubble-Lema&icirc;tre Law. Members will electronically
vote on this resolution later this year. Here's a bigger idea:
let's stop naming laws after people.</p>
<h3>Why the IAU XXX wishes to rename Hubble's Law</h3>
<p>Here are their main
points, summarized in my own words:</p>
<ol>
<li>The discovery that galaxies are flying away from us was <em>huge</em>.</li>
<li>Belgian astronomer Georges Lema&icirc;tre published this finding in 
1927 along with theoretical support before Hubble.</li>
<li>The journal he published in wasn't too popular so his findings were not widely 
circulated.</li>
<li>Lema&icirc;tre and Hubble attended a conference together in 1928 and talked 
about this expansion, Hubble later giving no attribution to Lema&icirc;tre.</li>
<li>Hubble's 1929 paper included new data that more strongly made the 
case for expansion and in it he proposes/derives a linear distance 
relationship which is what we now think of when referring to Hubble's Law.</li>
<li>Lema&icirc;tre essentially botched his chance to get more attribution when,
at the invitation of the Royal Astronomical Society, he published an English
translation of his paper but omitted the section where he derives the rate
of expansion thinking it wasn't of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>They make a very valid point, and if I had voting rights, I would vote for
this resolution. But let's, just for fun, look at a radical alternative.</p>
<h3>Why we should stop naming new laws after people, and rename old laws after concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>Discoveries are never clear-cut. Who gets credit for Calculus? Newton or Leibniz? 
Special relativity is often credited exclusively to Einstein, but be careful 
doing so around the French as there is a chance they may gleefully point out that 
Poincare had all the ingredients on the table before Einstein did, except the one 
magic ingredient that Einstein added, which was to 
<em>believe the math over any pre-conceived notions</em>. By doing so, Einstein was able to 
cook up all the ingredients properly and introduce a revolution in the way we
think about space and time.</li>
<li>Most French who will point out Poincare's contributions
do so out of national pride, for sure--Poincare was a tremendously talented 
scientist who is one of the founders of the field of Chaos Theory, for example. 
And while you can 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_priority_dispute">find some intelligent discussion</a> 
about how Relativity, both Special and General, were in the air and were the payoff of
a longer thread of mathematics and physics involving many contributors, that
discussion is tainted by historic and current anti-semitism, nasty bigots
who have long sought to discredit Einstein because he was of Jewish heritage.</li>
<li>Which goes to the bigger point. While it is perfectly healthy to have a historical
interest in science history, it is inevitably tainted with biases, nationalism, and
prejudices, and other nasty ingredients which belie the concept of science and 
mathematics as being a universal human endeavor.</li>
<li>The mathematical and scientific endeavor is a universal endeavor, and many of
the great early discoveries are named after mostly men and a few women who were
lucky enough to be parts of society that were empowered to be a part of that 
endeavor.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The bigger picture</h4>
<p>We are tremendously lucky to be living in a time where the opportunities
to join the mathematical and scientific endeavor are expanding more broadly. 
We must also not forget that for quite a long time, those opportunities were
quite limited. Were in not for Haskalah and Germany's introduction
of civil liberties for Jewish citizens, Einstein would likely never had had the 
opportunity to contribute to the body of science. We can find other examples like
Einstein in India, where the British rule was softening and British scientist were
becoming open to contributions from Indian science. Both 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/mar/31/research.highereducation">S Chandrasekhar (Chandrasekhar limit, our understanding of black holes)</a>
and his uncle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman">C. V. Raman (Raman scattering, quantum mechanics)</a>, 
went on to win a Nobel prize and have a major law or phenomenon named after them.
Without these historical openings, these phenomenons and laws would have 
very likely had European names attached to them instead. We could go on, of course,
and we haven't even started talking about the lack of opportunities afforded to 
women in science, historically. And who knows how many more contributions Alan
Turing could have made had bigotry not driven him to suicide? </p>
<p>Naming laws after people also has a negative effect on public perception of science
and math. It induces a culture of hero-worship that greatly skews the public's
concept of how math and science make progress. It is an iterative endeavor, where
from time to time particularly bright minds push the state of knowledge further
a decade or so, but always building upon work that came before them. 
Einstein's
General Relativity built on the work of the mathematician Riemann, for example,
as well as the field concepts of Maxwell. Newton's work built upon Euclid's 
mathematical contributions and Galileo's physical insights. The revolutions these
two helped ignite would have happened without them, only, it would have happened a bit
later. Leibniz worked out Calculus independently of Newton, and his formalism is
superior. 
Mathematicians and physicists on continental Europe made great strides with
the superior formalism both by making Calculus rigorous 
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23722354">(e.g. this discussion)</a> 
and by finding superior mathematical approaches to mechanics. Some
speculate that this is the case because British scientist were 
too long to overcome their devotion to their hero Newton's formalism <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974733">(see this article for 
a more nuanced view)</a>.</p>
<p>We are in a tremendously dangerous period in history, in some ways.
Science has become a global phenomenon for both better and worse. 
Science is a tool, as good or as evil as the intention behind it. 
We can be happy that there are scientist all over the globe working
to discover new laws that help us understand the universe, new treatments
to cancer, new ways to make our use of energy more efficient and renewable.
We can also be worried that there scientist all over the world engaged 
in research meant to find more efficient ways to kill other human beings.
As globalization distributes power centers more broadly around the world,
we should aim for the scientific endeavor to foster a sense of universalism
 and connectivity. The IAU XXX General Assembly should rename Hubble's Law
 as the Law of Cosmological Expansion. History will never forget the 
 contributions of Hubble and Lema&icirc;tre (and let's not forget those of 
 <a href="http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/08/big-bang-vote-iau-debates-who-gets-credit-for-expanding-universe">Howard Robertson</a>
 as well). The future, hopefully, belongs to all of us.</p>
